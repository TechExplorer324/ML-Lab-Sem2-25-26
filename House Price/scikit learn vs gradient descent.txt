When to use Scikit-learn for Linear Regression

You should use scikit-learn's LinearRegression class when you need a fast, reliable, and efficient solution for a standard data science project [1].

Practical application: You want to train a model quickly without worrying about the underlying math or optimization process.
Standard datasets: Your data is of a moderate size that fits comfortably in memory.
Benchmarking: You want to quickly establish a baseline model to compare against other, more complex models [2]. 
You can easily use the scikit-learn LinearRegression documentation to implement this. 



When to "use" Gradient Descent

While you generally implement gradient descent rather than just "using" it as a black box, it becomes relevant in specific scenarios [2, 3]: 
Educational purposes: To understand how machine learning models learn and how optimization works from scratch [2].

Custom loss functions: When your model requires a unique cost function that isn't built into standard libraries, you must manually define its gradient 
and implement the descent algorithm [3].

Massive datasets: For datasets too large to load into memory (out-of-core learning), variations like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or mini-batch gradient 
descent are used, often through specific scikit-learn classes like SGDRegressor which use gradient descent internally [1, 3].

Neural networks: Gradient descent and its variants (like backpropagation) are the fundamental algorithms used to train neural networks [2]. 
In short, scikit-learn is your go-to tool for practical linear regression tasks, while understanding and potentially implementing gradient descent is for educational purposes or specialized, complex scenarios [1, 2].
